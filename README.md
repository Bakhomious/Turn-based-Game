# Turn-based Strategy Game

A simple turn-based strategy game made in Unity.

## Basic Idea

The game consists of multiple rooms, in a rogue-like form, you have to clear all the rooms from enemies and collect an object. The game is completed when you collect all the achievements. The game is strategy based so, careful where you place your enemies.

Asset pack used: [POLYGON - Prototype Pack](https://syntystore.com/products/polygon-prototype-pack?_pos=1&_sid=0a95fae78&_ss=r)

I started this project as a challenge and to get ahold of the advanced features both in Unity and C#.

For personal documentation:

- Using OOP in making games.
- Handle complex user input, ex. mouse point and click using RayCast, selection of certain objects only.
- Singleton design pattern.
- More Testing skills.
- Usage of Cinemachines.
- Delegates in C#
- Abstraction in C#
- Events in Unity
- State Machines in C#
- Ragdoll
- Using AI for enemies
- Generics in C#
