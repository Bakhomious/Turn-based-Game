# Turn-based Strategy Game

A simple turn-based strategy game made in Unity.

Asset pack used: [POLYGON - Prototype Pack](https://syntystore.com/products/polygon-prototype-pack?_pos=1&_sid=0a95fae78&_ss=r)

I started this project as a challenge and to get ahold of the advanced features both in Unity and C#.

For personal documentation:

- Using OOP in making games.
- Handle complex user input, ex. mouse point and click using RayCast, selection of certain objects only.
- Singleton design pattern.
- More Testing skills.
- Usage of Cinemachines.
- Delegates in C#
- Abstraction in C#
- Events in Unity
- State Machines in C#
- Ragdoll
- Using AI for enemies
- Generics in C#
